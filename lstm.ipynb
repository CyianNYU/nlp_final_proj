      "\n",
      "So , you can see the same thing you &apos;re going to see .\n",
      "Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a little , I was a little bit of the world .\n",
      "It &apos;s a porous asphalt , like I said , so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones .\n",

      "\n",
      "It &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> .\n",
      "Due to weathering , due to <unk> light , due to oxidation , this binder , this bitumen , the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink , and if it shrinks , it gets <unk> , and it <unk> from the aggregates .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you &apos;re going to see the <unk> , you &apos;re going to do it .\n",
      "Then if you drive over the road , you take out the aggregates -- what we just saw here .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And so this is a lot of the way we need to do .\n",
      "To solve this problem , we thought of self-healing materials .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And if we can see the way that we can see that we can see .\n",
      "If we can make this material self-healing , then probably we have a solution .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to be a lot of the world , and we &apos;re going to be able to be a lot of the world .\n",
      "So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans , and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces , and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So , the first thing is the <unk> .\n",
      "So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can see , you see , you &apos;re going to see the <unk> .\n",
      "Then you need a machine , like you see here , that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> .\n",
      "Induction can heat , especially steel ; it &apos;s very good at that .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So , if you can see the <unk> , and it &apos;s a little bit of the <unk> , you &apos;re going to see the <unk> , you &apos;re going to see .\n",
      "Then what you do is you heat up the steel , you melt the bitumen , and the bitumen will flow into these <unk> , and the stones are again fixed to the surface .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s a very good , and I &apos;m going to be a very good .\n",
      "Today I use a microwave because I cannot take the big induction machine here onstage .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The <unk> , the <unk> , it &apos;s a very good .\n",
      "So a microwave is a similar system .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I &apos;m going to do , and I &apos;m going to do this , and I &apos;m going to do .\n",
      "So I put the specimen in , which I &apos;m now going to take out to see what happened .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a little bit of the same .\n",
      "So this is the specimen coming out now .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to do with the world , and we &apos;re going to do this .\n",
      "So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to do with the world , and we &apos;re not just going to do , and we &apos;re going to do it .\n",
      "We tested a lot of specimens there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s very interesting . We have to try that . &quot;\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And the world is the world , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to do it .\n",
      "So they donated to us a piece of highway , 400 meters of the <unk> , where we had to make a test track to test this material .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a lot of the first thing that we can see what we &apos;re going to do , and we &apos;re going to do it .\n",
      "So that &apos;s what we did here . You see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . That &apos;s what we know from practice .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to do with the world , and we &apos;re going to do it in the world .\n",
      "So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to do with the same time , and we &apos;re going to do it , and we &apos;re going to do it , and we &apos;re going to do .\n",
      "So we did aging on the samples , did a lot of loading on it , healed them with our induction machine , and healed them and tested them again .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We can see the same thing .\n",
      "Several times we can repeat that .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact , the problem is a lot of the first thing that we &apos;re going to do this , and we &apos;re going to do this , and we &apos;re going to do this , and we &apos;re going to do with the world , and we &apos;re going to do it , and we &apos;re going to do this , and we &apos;re going to do with the world , and\n",
      "So actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So , we have a lot of the world , and we can see the world , and we &apos;re going to be a lot of the world , and we &apos;re going to be a lot of the world , and we &apos;re going to be a lot of the world .\n",
      "Well , to conclude , I can say that we made a material using steel fibers , the addition of steel fibers , using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can &apos;t see what you do .\n",
      "And now you &apos;re of course curious if it also worked .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to do it , and it &apos;s a little .\n",
      "So we still have the specimen here . It &apos;s quite warm .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And I &apos;ve got to me , I can see , you can see , and I can see it .\n",
      "Actually , it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you &apos;re going to do .\n",
      "But I will do a trial .\n",

      "And we can see the same thing that we can see , and we can see the world , and we can see the world , we can see it .\n",
      "From the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You can see the <unk> , you &apos;re going to see the <unk> .\n",

      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to be a little .\n",
      "We see all the same symptoms .\n",

      "It &apos;s a little bit of the same .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;ve got a lot of data in the lab .\n",
      "So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to use it to do this , and we &apos;re going to do it , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , we have to be able to get rid of the <unk> .\n",
      "So they donated to us a piece of highway , 400 meters of the <unk> , where we had to make a test track to test this material .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what we &apos;re going to do is we see the next thing that we &apos;re going to do is that we have to do this , and we &apos;re going to do it again .\n",
      "So that &apos;s what we did here . You see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . That &apos;s what we know from practice .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to take a lot of a new technology .\n",
      "So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to use the same thing that we &apos;ve been able to do is we have to do with the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to go to the same time .\n",
      "So we did aging on the samples , did a lot of loading on it , healed them with our induction machine , and healed them and tested them again .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We can see the <unk> .\n",
      "Several times we can repeat that .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact , this is the first time that we &apos;re going to do this , and we &apos;re going to go back to the first time , and we &apos;re going to go back to the first time , and we &apos;re going to get the first time in the last few years , and we &apos;re going to see the other side of the brain .\n",
      "So actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So , this is a new way of the brain , which is a new way of the brain , which is the <unk> of the <unk> , and the brain is a <unk> , and the brain is a new way to make the <unk> .\n",
      "Well , to conclude , I can say that we made a material using steel fibers , the addition of steel fibers , using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you want to do that ?\n",
      "And now you &apos;re of course curious if it also worked .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We &apos;re going to see the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to see it .\n",
      "So we still have the specimen here . It &apos;s quite warm .\n",

      "So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So you have to be a <unk> .\n",
      "So you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And it &apos;s not just the same thing .\n",

      "Actually , my student <unk> , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And the other thing is , it &apos;s a very good thing .\n",
      "<unk> . Well , that &apos;s an improvement .\n",

      "So it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re not going to be able to get the same thing , and they said , &quot; You can &apos;t have a <unk> , and they said , &quot; Oh , you can &apos;t have a lot of people who are not going to be a <unk> , and they &apos;re not going to be able to get the <unk> .\n",
      "So what that means is that people will be able to — People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .\n",

In places like Tibet , there are no places to bury the dead , or wood to <unk> them , so these vultures provide a natural disposal system .', 'So what is the problem with vultures ?', 'We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya , of which six are highly threatened with extinction .', 'The reason is that they &apos;re getting poisoned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting poisoned is because there &apos;s <unk> conflicts . The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators , and in return , the vultures are falling victim to this .', 'In South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk> .', 'This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India , and they have taken a stand .', 'Because there are no vultures , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites , and when you have feral dogs , you have a huge time bomb of rabies . The number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India .', 'Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa : 353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana .', 'I am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind turbines do this to birds . They slice them in half .', 'They are <unk> machines .', 'In West Africa , there &apos;s a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market .', 'So what &apos;s being done ?

From these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction .', 'So why are vultures important ? First of all , they provide vital ecological services . They clean up .', 'They &apos;re our natural garbage collectors .', 'They clean up carcasses right to the bone .', 'They help to kill all the bacteria . They help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals .', 'Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures , carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose , and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases .', 'Vultures also have tremendous historical significance .', 'They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture .', '<unk> was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood , and together with the cobra , symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt .', 'In Hindu mythology , <unk> was the vulture god , and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the <unk> demon Ravana .', 'In Tibetan culture , they are performing very important sky burials . In places like Tibet , there are no places to bury the dead , or wood to <unk> them , so these vultures provide a natural disposal system .', 'So what is the problem with vultures ?', 'We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya , of which six are highly threatened with extinction .', 'The reason is that they &apos;re getting poisoned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting poisoned is because there &apos;s <unk> conflicts . The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators , and in return , the vultures are falling victim to this .', 'In South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk> .', 'This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India , and they have taken a stand .', 'Because there are no vultures , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites , and when you have feral dogs , you have a huge time bomb of rabies . The number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India .', 'Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa : 353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana .', 'I am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind turbines do this to birds . They slice them in half .', 'They are <unk> machines .', 'In West Africa , there &apos;s a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market .', 'So what &apos;s being done ?

you very much .', 'There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .', 'We don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .', 'So over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like stickers , stencils and chalk .', 'And these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?', 'How can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?', 'How can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?', 'And how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts , so our

for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .', 'In 2009 , I lost someone I loved very much .', 'Her name was Joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .', 'And I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .', 'But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .', 'I feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day , and forget what really matters to you .', 'So with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and <unk> it with a <unk> sentence : &quot; Before I die , I want to ... &quot; So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .', 'I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .', 'And I &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .', '&quot; Before I die , I want to be tried for piracy . &quot;', '&quot;

Before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;', 'So this neglected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they consoled me during my own tough times .', 'It &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .', 'It &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways .', 'It &apos;s about making space for reflection and contemplation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .', 'I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .', 'Together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .', 'Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .', 'In our age of increasing distractions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain
